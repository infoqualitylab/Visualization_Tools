# List of Visualization Tools
This is a developing list of potential visualization tools (in alphabetical order) based on an independent study carried out by Halle Burns (GitHub: hburns2). The initial tools within this list were identified based on a literature review investigating visualization tools and techniques that could be utilized to showcase and explore linked data. With additions from future students, this author expects the scope of this list to become broader. It is important to note that the numerical ranking system utilzied in this list is inherently biased, and reflects what the initial author believes would be suitable and/or easy to use for data and visualization novices. The rating system is as follows:

1. This tool requires no previous background knowledge or skills. With some experimentation, it is reasonably easy to navigate and to understand.
2.
3. Requires some background knowledge to use the tool. While this does not involve coding on the part of the user, it does involve basic understanding of concepts relating to data structures or coding languages.
4.
5. This tool requires a) working knowledge of a scripting language, b) an unclear or complex interface, c) complex to install (requiring knowledge of command line or a scripting language), d) add-ons or other programs necessary to run the tool, and/or e) dense documentation

**Note: For any additional tools that are added to this list, in order to maintain consistency, the author requests that subsequent contributers to maintain to the evaluation format demonstrated below.**

## LodLive
**Ranking:** 3 <br/>
<br/>
**Background:** http://en.lodlive.it/ --> LodLive runs in a broswer. "LodLive is an experimental project that was set-up to spread and promote the linked-open-data philosophy and to create a tool that can be used for connecting RDF browser capabilities with the effectiveness of data graph representation. LodLive is the first navigator to use RDF resources based solely on SPARQL endpoints." This tool appears to still be in the early stages, as much is labeled as "Coming Soon."<br/>
<br/>
**Paywall?:** No <br/>
<br/>
**Data types (import):** Because LodLive works in the browser and directly with SPARQL endpoints, most data being "imported" comes from a URI. Within the Simple Search element, the user is able to browse keywords from either DBpedia or Freebase. Once a keyword is chosen, the beginnings of a graph will appear. <br/>
<br/>
**Data types (export):** Unknown. <br/>
<br/>
**Types of visualizations:** Linked data relationships. <br/>
<br/>
**Special/Unique features:** While it is still "Coming Soon," hopefully in the near future, users will be able to insert their own RDF data. Additionally, in the graphical interface, when selecting a resource, it is possible to view additional information. For example, this author investigated DBpedia's "Zika virus" keyword in the "Simple Search" feature. When selecting the icon that appears like a small document, information from the DBpedia page on the Zika virus appear, including images and a description. Should this feature be included once users can upload their own RDF, users would be able to provide their own labels. The graphical interface also connects to Google maps, however this is currently still just for development purposes. <br/>
<br/>
**Analysis:** Because this tool is rooted in linked data and SPARQL, prior knowledge of these topics can assist with navigating the space. Understanding the linked data nature of the generated data as well as the terms utilized assists with understanding the querying and the output. Additionally, there is a bit of a learning curve in navigating the tool, as many symbols are utilized to stand in for specific concepts (i.e. inverse relations, direct relations, groups of direct relations, etc.). It is also important to note that this tool is good for exploring data and subsequent linked data relationships but would not be suitable for an easily accessible, public-facing visualization. This is a new tool, still actively being developed, meaning that elements of the tool, as well as any available documentation, is in flux and can alter. <br/>

**Background:** http://www.linkeddatatools.com/rdf-studio --> <br/>
<br/>
**Paywall?:** Yes. RDF Studio can be used for free for 21 days. At the end of that time, the user will be prompted to purchase a subscription or license for the product. Students or academic institutions may qualify for free or discounted rates. <br/>

## VOSviewer
**Ranking:** 1 <br/>
<br/>
**Background:** http://www.vosviewer.com/ --> This tool was initially built as a way to "visualize scientific landscapes." The VOSviewer GUI can be downloaded for personal use. <br/>
<br/>
**Paywall?:** No.<br/>
<br/>
**Data types (import):** .csv, .txt, reference management files (RIS, EndNote, RefWorks), database files (from Web of Science, Scopus, Dimensions, and PubMed), and select APIs.<br/>
<br/>
**Data types (export):** .csv, .txt, .eps, .gif, .jpg, .pdf, .png, .svg, .swf, .tiff. <br/>
<br/>
**Types of visualizations:** Networks (bibliographic, co-citation, co-authorship, co-occurance). Can be visualized as network, overlay, or density visualizations.<br/>
<br/>
**Special/Unique features:** This tool allows some elements of analysis to occur once data is imported. This varies from adjusting the clustering to the normalization of the data points selected.<br/>
<br/>
**Analysis:** While this tool is fairly easy to use, the customizable options are extremely limited. Unlike other network-based tools, the user is only able to employ 3 basic models for their data (network, overlay, and density) and can only manipulate certain aspects. The clusters of visualized data, as far as this author can tell, is unable to be manually moved. This tool is particularly useful for novices or for someone looking to create something quickly and easily.<br/>
